How to install
--------------

To install Z-Push, simply untar the z-push tar, e.g. with:
   tar -xzvf z-push-[version]-{buildnr}.tar.gz
   
The tar contains a folder with the structure:
    z-push-[version]-{buildnr}
    
The contents of this folder should be copied to /usr/share/z-push.
Case this folder does not exist yet, create it with:
    mkdir /usr/share/z-push

    cp -R z-push-[version]-{buildnr}/* /usr/share/z-push/

Now, edit the config.php file in the directory to reflect your local system.
For MAPI use with Zarafa, you do not need to change any settings. It should work as-is.
Please also set your timezone in the config.php file.

The state directory is by default /var/lib/z-push, the log directory /var/log/z-push.
Make sure that these directories exist and are writeable for your webserver
process, so either change the owner of these directories to the UID of
your apache process or make the directory world writeable:

    chmod 777 /var/lib/z-push
    chmod 777 /var/log/z-push

Now, you must configure Apache to redirect the URL
'Microsoft-Server-ActiveSync' to the index.php file in the Z-Push
directory. This can be done by adding the line:

    Alias /Microsoft-Server-ActiveSync /usr/share/z-push/index.php

to your httpd.conf file. Make sure that you are adding the line to the
correct part of your Apache configuration, taking care of virtual hosts and
other Apache configurations.

*WARNING* You CANNOT simply rename the z-push directory to
Microsoft-Server-ActiveSync. This will cause Apache to send redirects to the
PDA, which will definitely break your PDA synchronisation.

Lastly, make sure that PHP has the following settings:

    php_flag magic_quotes_gpc off
    php_flag register_globals off
    php_flag magic_quotes_runtime off
    php_flag short_open_tag on

You can set this in the httpd.conf, in php.ini or in an .htaccess file in
the root of z-push. If you don't set this up correctly, you will not be
able to login correctly via z-push.

Z-Push writes files to your file system like logs or data from the
FileStateMachine (which is default). In order to make this possible,
you either need to disable the php-safe-mode in php.ini or .htaccess with
    php_admin_flag safe_mode off
or configure it accordingly, so Z-Push is allowed to write to the 
log & state directories. 

After doing this, you should be able to synchronize from your PDA.


Update to newer Z-Push versions
-------------------------------

Upgrading to a newer Z-Push version follows the same path as the initial 
installation.

Please observe the published release notes of the new Z-Push version.
For some releases it is necessary to e.g. resynchronize the mobile.


Setting up your mobile device
-----------------------------

This is simply a case of adding an 'exchange server' to your activesync
server list, specifying the IP address of the Z-Push apache server,
disabling SSL, unless you have already setup SSL on your Apache server,
setting the correct username & password (the domain is ignored, you can
simply specify 'domain' or some other random string), and then going through
the standard activesync settings.

Once you have done this, you should be able to synchronise your mobile
simply by clicking the 'Sync' button in ActiveSync on your mobile.


Troubleshooting
---------------

Most problems will be caused by incorrect Apache settings. To test whether
your Apache setup is working correctly, you can simply type the Z-Push URL
in your browser, to see if apache is correctly redirecting your request to
z-push. You can simply use:

    http://<serverip>/Microsoft-Server-ActiveSync

If correctly configured, you should see a username/password request and
when you specify a valid username & password, you should see a Z-Push
information page, saying that this kind of requests are not supported.
Without authentication credentials, Z-Push displays general information.

If not, then check your PHP and Apache settings.

If you have other synchronisation problems, you can increase the LOGLEVEL
parameter in the config e.g. to LOGLEVEL_DEBUG or LOGLEVEL_WBXML.

The z-push.log file will then collect detailed debug information from your
synchronisation.
